# Modify this file to change the available default wands.
# New wands can be added, existing wands modified or removed (disabled)
#
# You can also add individual files to the wands/ folder

#
# This is the Wand configuration file for the Magic plugin.
#
# This defines all of the wand "templates" that can be created with the
# /wand and /wandp commands.
#
# Once a wand is created, it is its own unique item. It may be modified after that,
# and may bear no direct relationship back to the template that created it.
#
# The name and description, of a wand should be defined in messages.yml as
#  messages.wands.<wandkey>.name
#  messages.wands.<wandkey>.description
#
# Note that wands can also be renamed on an anvil.
#
# There are two special entries in here:
# - The "default" wand is used as a template when creating a new and with /wand.
# - The "random" wand has a different and specific configuration format.
#
# General format:
#
# <wandkey>:
#
#       # If true, this wand can not be enchanted, combined or otherwise modified
#
#       modifiable: true
#
#       # Set to false to disable a preset wand
#       enabled: <true|false>
#
