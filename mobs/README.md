# Mobs

`/mobs/` contains files that define custom mobs that can interact with various facets of the Magic plugin. Each mob has their own file.

### Spawning mobs

To spawn a BetterPotter mob perform the following command:

`/mmob spawn <mob_identifier> [amount]`

For other mob-related commands type `/mmob`
