# Paths

`/paths/` contains files that modify the existing pathing graduation system to immersively progress the player. These files re-arrange the order in which players learn the spells included in Magic along with the large amount of custom spells that BetterPotter adds.

More on paths [here](https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/Custom-Paths).
