# BetterPotter

This is a set of improvements and expansions upon the Potter example configs built-in to NathanWolf's Magic plugin.

The goal of this project is to make a more developed, cohesive and lore-accurate experience.

## Custom Spells

There are a couple of spells in the base configuration of these files which are not a part of Harry Potter lore; however, all spells are based off of known spells, named or unnamed, in the Potter universe.
