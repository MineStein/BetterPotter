## To do

#### General

* Move common effects into effects folder (like the knowledge gained one used when upgrading or using potions)
* Consider whether attributes should stay or not
* Review default files
* Re-balance how the year upgrades work and what they change
* Document aspects of the configuration so that BetterPotter can be used as an example for other configs

#### Spells

* Make sure all spells have sounds
* Clean up spell files (order their sections consistently and remove unnecessary flags)
* Add dark upgrade for `flight` and `apparate`
* Check Fantastic Beasts for new spells and review online spell lists
* Re-do spells in the to_redo file
* Change `bubblehead` so that the item doesn't say diving helmet
* Add Riddikulus

#### Items

* Remembrall -> Flashes pink and red glass and tells you if you have any lost wands
* Quidditch balls -> Based on flashbang spell, bounces around with more speed
* Skiving snackboxes -> A box of snacks which cause illness
* Decoy detonators -> Sends a hopper projectile which explodes to create a distraction
* Finish list of potions

#### Mobs

General ideas

* Add distances to mobs so they are less persistent
* Make mobs more aggressive as they get damaged with `min_damage` flags, etc.

Specific mobs

* Snatcher -> A less-powerful deatheather
* Deatheater -> Geared-out zombie with slowness that can cast a number of spells
* Dementor -> A wither who can drain you, slowing you down with a wither effect
* Thestral -> Skeletal horse
* Owl -> Bats, maybe drops random things like papers?
* House-Elf -> Baby villagers with light magic
* Goblin -> Another baby villager
