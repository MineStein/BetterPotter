## TODO

### General

* Make sure every spell has sounds

* Finish spells in to_redo.yml
* Overhaul spells with attributes
* Add brooms again
* Convert to use custom currency system
* Change upgrade_commands on year up

* Define some automata
* Consider changing upgrade messages
* Remove unnecessary parameters from spells
* Make actions and effects consistent (`class: SphereEffect` -> ` class: Sphere` or `class: VelocityAction` -> `class: Velocity`)

### Known bugs
