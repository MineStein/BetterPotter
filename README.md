## TODO

### General

* Make sure every spell has sounds
* Overhaul messages to be more stylistically neutral
* Finish spells in to_redo.yml
* Overhaul spells with attributes
* Add brooms again
* Convert to use custom currency system
* Change upgrade_commands on year up
* Add .gitattributes
* Define some automata
* Consider changing upgrade messages
* Remove unnecessary parameters from spells
* Make actions and effects consistent (`class: SphereEffect` -> ` class: Sphere` or `class: VelocityAction` -> `class: Velocity`)
* Add distances to mobs so they are less crazy persistent
* Update wiki with more stuff, fix folder structure info
* Implement longapparate based on recall again

### Known bugs

#### Spells

* Obliviate maxima doesn't work, obliviate does
* Some spells give errors on load and don't appear, can't seem to see what's wrong with them (flagellos, multabasorium, incarcifors, baubillious)
* Wingardium leviosa doesn't actually lift blocks like it used to

### Other ideas

#### Items

* Gillyweed item -> bubblehead charm with uses
* Beaded handbag -> stash spell

#### Mobs

* Snatcher
* Deatheater
* Dementor
* Lethifold
* Thestral
* Owl
