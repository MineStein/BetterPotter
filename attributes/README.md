# Attributes

`/attributes/` contains files that define custom attributes that are attached to the player. These attributes are created but do not serve a functional purpose yet as they are still a work-in-progress feature of Magic.

More on Magic attributes [here](https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/Attributes).
