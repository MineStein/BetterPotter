## File structure

The key to understanding and configuring your installation of BetterPotter is to know the file structure.

`/potter/` contains the default Potter files for reference while developing the configuration.


`/messages/` contains most of the plugin messages.


`/spells/` contains the spells of the plugin.


`/spells/other/` contains various specialty spells, along with those that are enabled, disabled, or are in
the process of a rewrite.


`/spells/not_canon/` contains the spells which are either fictional in the Harry Potter universe or are unnamed spells from the lore with a Latin incantation.
