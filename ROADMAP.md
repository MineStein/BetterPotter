## To do

#### General

* Move common effects into effects folder (like the knowledge gained one used when upgrading or using potions)
* Review default files
* Re-balance how the year upgrades work and what they change

#### Spells

* Make sure all spells have sounds
* Clean up spell files (order their sections consistently and remove unnecessary flags)
* Check Fantastic Beasts for new spells and review online spell lists

* Riddikulus
* Felifors - Turns cats into cauldrons temporarily

#### Items

* Remembrall -> Flashes pink and red glass and tells you if you have any lost wands
* Quidditch balls -> Based on flashbang spell, bounces around with more speed
* Skiving snackboxes -> A box of snacks which cause illness
* Decoy detonators -> Sends a hopper projectile which explodes to create a distraction
* Invisibility cloak -> Creates a shield particle effect, and vanishes the caster, stashing the wand and applying a slight slowness debuff
* Philosopher's stone -> Maybe just a cosmetic item with high value, but could also bring up a selector to convert metal to gold
* Wizard Crackers -> Short range throwable crackers that pop and create small fireworks
* Dissimulator -> A musical instrument that plays music and sounds with puffs of multi-colored smoke
* Exploding Snap Cards -> Pieces of (paper?) that explode when thrown

* Make mobs more aggressive as they get damaged with `min_damage` flags, etc.

Specific mobs

* Flobberworms -> Endermite or Silverfish with no AI that drops Flobberworm Mucus (slime balls) when killed
* Chizpurfles -> Cave spiders with low health and no interesting attributes
* Diricawls -> Some type of flightless bird (maybe no AI) that casts a modified apparate when attacked
* Fairies -> Take a look at how Magic did fairies by default
* Grindylows -> Squids with short-distance offensive spells
* Jobberknolls -> Bird that makes no sounds and then dies and releases a long, loud scream
* Puffskeins -> Pufferfish with no AI?
* Doxys - Vexes that have short-ranged offensive attacks and float around. Doxy Queen variants.
* Jarveys -> Foxes that call the player rude names and can short-range offensive attack similar to Wampuses
* Leprechauns -> Baby villagers that drop small amounts of galleons upon death
* Pixies - Vexes that spawn in swarms with low health, float around and debuff the player slightly but strong in groups
* Snatcher -> A less-powerful deatheather
* Deatheater -> Geared-out zombie with slowness that can cast a number of spells
* Dementor -> A wither who can drain you, slowing you down with a wither effect
* Thestral -> Skeletal horse
* Owl -> Bats, maybe drops random things like papers?
* House-Elf -> Baby villagers with light magic
* Goblin -> Another baby villager
