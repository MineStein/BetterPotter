  # Used as a substitute item when the wand item is naturally crafted
  # This is mainly for the resource pack, so players don't craft a wood hoe
  # and get some weird non-wand but wand-looking item.
  # This means that, by default, crafting a wood hoe will get you an iron hoe.
  # If you don't want this behavior, just empty out this field.
